In the land of Czechia, where the Vltava River flows and code runs like a well-oiled machine, emerges Zita—the programmer extraordinaire with a knack for turning syntax into symphonies.

Juggling React, Node.js, and Python like a true fullstack sorceress, Zita effortlessly weaves her way through the binary labyrinth. Yet, amidst the sea of bits and bytes, she finds herself in a perpetual struggle against the boy's club of programming, wielding irony and humor as her secret weapons.

When not decoding algorithms, Zita tackles the real-world puzzles of apartment cleaning, lending an ironic twist to domestic adventures. Podcasts serenade her ears, books and magazines transport her to distant realms, and if there's one thing she loves more than unraveling code, it's unraveling her suitcase—because for Zita, traveling is the ultimate escapade.

Join us as we dive into the whimsical world of Zita, where laughter is the best syntax!
