    Zita, the Czech coding sensation, can debug a program with one hand tied
    behind her back, all while sipping on a cup of absinthe.
  </p>
  <p class="pt-2">
    Her code is so clean, it once brought a tear to an old compiler's eye, who
    never thought it would witness such elegance.
  </p>
  <p class="pt-2">
    Rumor has it that Zita's keyboard has a secret admiration mode that
    activates whenever she starts typing â€“ even the most stoic lines of code
    can't help but blush.
